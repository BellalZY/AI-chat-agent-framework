The function of the pump is to pressurize the spray arms, and in most models, it is also used to drain the water. The pump sits at the bottom of the dishwasher and typically consists of two separate compartments; one for wash or circulation and the other for draining. The circulation part of the pump will typically consist of the wash impeller and the filter components while the drain portion will consist of a drain impeller and a chopper blade or in some cases, a solenoid operated diverter. The impellers are driven by an electric motor that is attached to the bottom or side of the pump."

If the screen is plugged, water flow will be restricted, and the result will be small or layered ice cubes. Remove and clean the screen if it is clogged. If dirt has gotten into the valve it may not shut off completely and will continuously drip water into the ice maker fill tube and will eventually freeze up. Low household water pressure or a restriction at the manual shut off valve will also cause the water inlet valve to not shut off completely and create this same condition. Self piercing saddle valves are the most common shut off valve to cause this problem as the hole that is pierced in the water line is often too small and will more easily become restricted."
